## About
Welcome to Jenna's Runbooks where I'll be documenting my technical journey diving into topics such as Multi-Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP), DevOps, Networking, Security and Automation.

**NOTE:** As of March 2023, this site is no longer being maintained. All existing articles have been migrated to my [Hashnode](https://blog.jennasrunbooks.com/) blog where I'm actively contributing new content on a regular basis. Thanks for stopping by and I hope to see you over on Hashnode!
