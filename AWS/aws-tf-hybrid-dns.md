# Hybrid DNS between AWS and On-prem Terraform Deployment

_Last updated: July 01, 2022_

## Overview
The purpose of this runbook is to demonstrate the implementation of an AWS Hybrid DNS design and architecture between 2 separate AWS regions. The intent of this design is to simulate private DNS resolution over an established inter-region AWS VPC Peering connection in addition to various Route 53 and Bind DNS server components.

### Pre-requisites

- GitHub Account
- AWS Account
- Terraform [installed](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

### Design Artifacts

- Simulated AWS Hybrid DNS Network Design Architecture: []()
- Actual AWS Hybrid DNS Network Design Architecture: []()
- Clone the repo containing the terraform artifacts for the AWS Hybrid DNS design here: [jksprattler/aws-networking](https://github.com/jksprattler/aws-networking.git)
  - relevant files are under `/aws-terraform-hybrid-dns`

### Architecture



Route 53 private hosted zone, Route 53 inbound and outbound endpoints. and an On-prem Environment. Terraform Deployment
